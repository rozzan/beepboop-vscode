Custom Colours
--------------
If there are some colours you do not like from this theme, you can change them in `User Settings`! Use the objects `workbench.colorCustomizations` and `workbench.tokenColorCustomizations` to override one or more colours:

```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {

	"editor.background": "#495AC1",
	"editor.foreground": "#FAFEF0",
	"sideBar.background": "#7BA4F4"

},
"workbench.tokenColorCustomizations": {

	"numbers": "#73C7AA",
	"comments": "#323330"

},
```

Please note that this will override the specified values across **ALL** themes until they are removed from `User Settings`.
